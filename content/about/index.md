Hello! My name is *Sonu Sharma* and I mostly build things for the *web*. I started my web dev journey in high school, I fell in love with it upon discovering how fast I could transform these ideas in my head into actual things that do something, are impactful.

Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at a start-up, where I mostly work on building and maintaining internal tools used to manage multiple *back-ends* and *microservices* and I also work on various other projects and get to work-on/implement awesome tools [Typesense](https://typesense.org/), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) ..., etc. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products with best possible digital experience in mind.
