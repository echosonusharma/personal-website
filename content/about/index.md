Hello! My name is *Sonu Sharma* and I mostly build things for the *web*. I started my web dev journey in highschool, I fell in love with it upon descovering how fast I could transform these ideas in my head into actual things that do something, are impactful.

Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working at a start-up, where I mostly work on building and mataining internal tools used to manage multiple *backends* and *microservices* and I work on various other projects and get to work-on/implement awesome tools Typesense, OpenAI ...,etc. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products with best possible digital experience in mind.
